<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello, my name is Marius Iancu, I am 32 years old and I live in Spain.It's a beautiful country, that's why I want to learn programming so I can change my lifestyle,and I hope to have more time for myself, for my family and for those close to me.</p>

<p>At the moment I work in one of the largest producers of meat products and preparations in Spain, namely
  Costa Brava Mediterranean Foods.<br />

  I learned a lot of new things from people with a lot of experience in the field but also experimenting myself, and still I want to learn something different and I chose programming, because you can do an infinity of things.<br />
</p>

<p>Another thing I can say about myself is that I manage a meat shop, where we produce smoked meat with Romanian tradition.Meat products that are more natural than those in supermarkets</p>
